// Here are all the commands for making ntuple from nmea format log

//Description of nmea format : below page is one of example
https://receiverhelp.trimble.com/alloy-gnss/en-us/NMEA-0183messages_MessageOverview.html
//My script only check fixed position, orbit of each satellite and c/n[0], but other info. is included in nmea data.



// Remark //

// information about date isnt contained in nmea data,
// so we should add date by ourselves,
// but my script isnt considered it.

// position fixed data is outputed as "pos***"
// but i dont prepare script that they converted to ntuple.




//Usage // 


//Environment
//Assuming setup when kamioka cumputer system
//I use root_v5.34.38, but other version seems to work 
> source /usr/local/sklib_gcc8/root_v5.34.38/bin/thisroot.sh


//Go to working directory
// and build the executables
> cd **/nmeaplot/
> g++ -o conv_nmea conv_nmea.cc
> g++ -o conv_satfile conv_satfile.cc
> g++ `root-config --cflags --libs` -o make_tree make_tree.cc



//Convert nmea file and make ntuple
> ./nmeaplot.sh (input nmea file) (output direcroty)


//Output ntuple file "tree.root"

//ntuple desctiption
sat 
    0 : GPS (SBAS also contain)
    1 : GLONASS
    2 : Galileo
    3 : BeiDou
    4 : QZSS

fix 
    0 : tracked, but dont used to positon fix
    1 : used to position fix

e.g.
tree->Draw("elev:azim:cn0","","colz") // correlation b/w sat. orbit and c/n0
tree->Draw("t","fix==1 && sat == 0") //# of GPS used to position fixed
